# LZ77_DATA_COMPRESSION
LZ77 ( Lempel-Ziv-1977) is a simple but surprisingly effective form of data compression that takes an entirely different approach from Huffman coding. LZ77 is a dictionary-based method, which means that it tries to compress data by encoding long strings of symbols, called phrases, as small tokens that reference entries in a dictionary. Compression is achieved by using relatively small tokens in place of longer phrases that appear several times in the data. As with Huffman coding, it is important to realize that a symbol is not necessarily a character of text: a symbol can be any amount of data we choose, but it is often one byteâ€™s worth.
